The objective of this project was to integrate standard React buttons with a .gltf model within React Three Fiber. The challenge was in achieving this without recourse to the <HTML /> helper from the React-Three/Drei library. The model, rendered in wireframe, displays a traditional Samoan house known as a "fale." Through button clicks, users access information pertaining to key components of the structure, with corresponding parts of the house highlighted dynamically. Additionally, a language toggle feature has been implemented,  making the information available in the English and Samoan language.
